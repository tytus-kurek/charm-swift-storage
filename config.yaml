options:
  openstack-origin:
    default: distro
    type: string
    description: |
      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include:

      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/updates
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/staging
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/proposed

      For series=Precise we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * icehouse

      For series=Trusty we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * juno
         * kilo
         * ...

      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade.
  block-device:
    default: sdb
    type: string
    description: |
      Device to be used to back Swift storage.  May be any valid block
      device or a path and size to a local file (/path/to/file.img|$sizeG),
      which will be created and used as a loopback device (for testing only).
      Multiple devices may be specified as a space-separated list of devices.
      If set to "guess", the charm will attempt to format and mount all extra
      block devices (this is currently experimental and potentially dangerous).
  overwrite:
    default: "false"
    type: string
    description: |
      If true, charm will attempt to unmount and overwrite existing and in-use
      block-devices (WARNING).
  ephemeral-unmount:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Cloud instances provide ephermeral storage which is normally mounted
      on /mnt.
      .
      Setting this option to the path of the ephemeral mountpoint will force
      an unmount of the corresponding device so that it can be used as a swift
      storage device. This is useful for testing purposes (cloud deployment
      is not a typical use case).
  zone:
    default: 1
    type: int
    description: |
      Swift storage zone to request membership.  Relevant only when the
      swift-proxy charm has been configured for manual zone assignment
      (the default).  This should be changed for every service unit.
  object-server-port:
    default: 6000
    type: int
    description: Listening port of the swift-object-server.
  container-server-port:
    default: 6001
    type: int
    description: Listening port of the swift-container-server.

    type: float
    description: |
      The CPU multiplier to use when configuring worker processes for the
      account, container and object server processes.
  object-server-threads-per-disk:
    default: 4
    type: int
    description: |
      Size of the per-disk thread pool used for performing disk I/O. 0 means
      to not use a per-disk thread pool. It is recommended to keep this value
      small, as large values can result in high read latencies due to large
      queue depths. A good starting point is 4 threads per disk.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.

      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  account-max-connections:
    default: 2
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of connections allowed to the account rsync stanza.

  nagios-check-params:
    default: "-m -r 60 180 10 20"
    type: string
    description: String appended to nagios check
  nagios_context:
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
  harden:
    default:
    type: string
    description: |
      Apply system hardening. Supports a space-delimited list of modules
      to run. Supported modules currently include os, ssh, apache and mysql.

    default:
    description: |
      YAML formatted associative array of sysctl values, e.g.:
      '{ kernel.pid_max : 4194303 }'
  statsd-host:
    default: ''
    type: string
    description: |
      Enable statsd metrics to be sent to the specified host.
      If this value is empty, statsd logging will be disabled.
  statsd-port:
    default: 3125
    type: int
    description: |

  enable-firewall:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      By default the swift-storage charm will use the UFW firewall to
      protect storage daemons. This option allows the administrator to
      disable this feature.
  allow-ufw-ip6-softfail:
    description: |
      When this option is set to True the charm will disable the IPv6
      support in ufw in case ip6tables couldn't be activated, situations
      where this could happen is in a LXC container running on top of a
      host that doesn't have loaded the ip6_tables.

      If this option is False (the default) and ip6_tables module couldn't
      be loaded, the charm will fail to install.
    type: boolean
    default: False
  encrypt:
    default: false
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Encrypt block devices used by swift using dm-crypt, making use of
      vault for encryption key management; requires a relation to vault.
  region:

    description: |
      Swift storage region to request membership. Relevant only when the
      swift-proxy charm has been configured with the "enable-multi-region=True"
      option. This should be changed for every service unit
