summary: OpenStack Object Storage - Swift storage service
maintainer: OpenStack Charmers <openstack-charmers@lists.ubuntu.com>
description: |
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and
 then updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this
 type of storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email
 storage and backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of
 control provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.

 This charm deploys the Swift storage service, supporting HTTP based access
 via Swift proxy services.
